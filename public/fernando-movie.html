<h1>The Best Moivies According to Fernando</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie of all time, Christopher Nolan made a work of art with this movie. Everything that has to do with the universe I find fascinating. </p>
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>The story and Hans Zimmer's music transport you into the movie. I hated Joaquin Phoneix for years for the role he played as Comodo.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>The best super hero movie ever made by far.</p>
